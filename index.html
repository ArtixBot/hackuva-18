		<h1>Real-Time Data Collection. Daily Results.</h1>
		<p>Data breaches have become one of the most concerning and pressing security issues in the realm of computer security. With data breaches becoming a more
		common occurrence, it can be difficult to remember which sites you've input sensitive information into.</p>
		<p>Wisper removes the need to memorize such sites by doing that job for you, along with providing helpful
		information on when you provided such information.</p>
		<p>Has a site been breached? Utilize Wisper's logs to see if you've ever input personal info into that site, and take appropriate action based on the results!</p>
	</div>

		<h1>How it Works</h1>
		<p>Wisper is a free, open-source program which keeps track of your keyboard input and cross-checks it with a provided list of "personal information fields."
		In the event that you type out some phrase or number which corresponds with one of these fields, Wisper will log this information for
		future reference, allowing to see what sites and what time did you type out this information.</p>
		<p>Wisper runs completely offline, so your data cannot be stolen or downloaded from outside sources.</p>

		<h1>Download Instructions</h1>
		<p>Download the .zip file, available at the bottom of this page.</p>
		<p>Unzip the file and run main.py.</p>
		<p>Input sensitive data fields via option (1).</p>
		<p>Start up Wisper via option (4).</p>
		<p>Exit at any time by pressing Esc, then 'x' or 'X.'</p>
